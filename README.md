# ParallelWebDriver #
This is a sample project for the parallel test execution with RemoteWebDriver.

I used the https://rationaleemotions.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/parallel-webdriver-executions-using-testng/ page to lead my design.

You should create a similar structure on your drive:

## Run the Demo ##
Run the testng.xml as TetNG Suite in Eclipse.
